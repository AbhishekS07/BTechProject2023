The developed system is job recommendation system for recruitment which helps college placement office to match company’s profiles and student’s profiles with higher precision and lower cost. For profile matching, two matching methods are used: semantic matching, tree-based knowledge matching. These methods are integrated according to representations of attributes of students and companies, and then the profile similarity degree is acquired.
